Open MetaDesign Toolkit
=======================

An open and digital toolkit for developing the metadesign (the design of the design process and system) of the collaboration and community of Open projects.

Instructions
------------

1. Install the *Titillium* font (you can find it in the **resources/fonts** folder)
2. If you don't have a vector drawing software, install the open source software [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) for editing the source files in the .svg file format
3. Add the **metadesign** folder to your open projects folder
4. Go to the **source** directory and edit the files there
4. Plan your process by editing the **01.process_participation.matrix.svg** file first. Edit it and export the files as .png in the main **metadesign** folder
5. Analyse your community by editing the files **02.analysis_community.activity.svg** and **02.analysis_community.social.network.svg**. Edit them and export the files as .png in the main **metadesign** folder
6. Design your Open Design activity by editing the files **03.design_activity.design.svg**, **03.design_blueprint.svg**, **03.design_business.model.canvas.svg**, **03.design_motivation.matrix.svg**, **03.design_storyboard.svg**, **03.design_system_map.svg**. Edit them, export the files as .png in the main **metadesign** folder, 
7. You can create comics for the storyboard by following the link to a comic generator software in the **resources/storyboard_generator** folder
8. You can find links to open source icons under the folder **resources/icons** for your System Map


Include the toolkit on your GitHub project
------------------------------------------
You can download the toolkit and copy on your project folder (and **this is the best way of including the toolkit in your project**), or you can do a little hack and fork the toolkit to a new repository for your account, rename it and start developing your project.

1. Go to [https://github.com/OpenP2PDesignOrg/OpenMetaDesignToolkit](https://github.com/](OpenP2PDesignOrg/OpenMetaDesignToolkit) and click on **Fork**
2. Then go to your new forked repository on GitHub, and click on **Settings**
3. Rename your repository and edit its description, this will be your new repository with the Open MetaDesign toolkit already included!
