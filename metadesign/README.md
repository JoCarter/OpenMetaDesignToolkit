Instructions
------------

1. Install the Titillium font (you can find it in the *resources/fonts* folder)

3. Add the *metadesign* folder to your open projects folder
4. Start editing the *process_participation_matrix.svg* file, designing the whole design process
5. Choose the tools that you want to include in your *metadesign* folder, edit them, export the files as .png in the main *metadesign* folder, and delete the others
6. You can create comics for the storyboard by using the *storyboard_generator* software in the *resources/storyboard_generator* folder
7. You can find open source icons under the folder *resources/icons* for your System Map
