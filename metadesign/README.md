Open MetaDesign Toolkit
=======================

An open and digital toolkit for developing the metadesign (the design of the design process and system) of the collaboration and community of Open projects.

Instructions
------------

1. Install the Titillium font (you can find it in the *resources/fonts* folder)
2. If you don't have a vector drawing software, install the open source software [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) for editing the source files in the .svg file format
3. Add the *metadesign* folder to your open projects folder
4. Start editing the *process_participation_matrix.svg* file first, designing the whole design process
5. In the *source* directory, choose the other files that you want to include in your *metadesign* folder, edit them, export the files as .png in the main *metadesign* folder, and delete the others
6. You can create comics for the storyboard by using the *storyboard_generator* software in the *resources/storyboard_generator* folder
7. You can find open source icons under the folder *resources/icons* for your System Map


Include the toolkit on your GitHub project
------------------------------------------
You can download the toolkit and copy on your project folder (and **this is the best way of including the toolkit in your project***), or you can do a little hack and fork the toolkit to a new repository for your account, rename it and start developing your project.

1. Go to [https://github.com/OpenP2PDesignOrg/OpenMetaDesignToolkit](https://github.com/](OpenP2PDesignOrg/OpenMetaDesignToolkit) and click on **Fork**
2. Then go to your new forked repository on GitHub, and click on **Settings**
3. Rename your repository and edit its description, this will be your new repository with the Open MetaDesign toolkit already included!
